	<h3><strong>About The Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>This theme is designed for use with WordPress 2.7 or higher. The code was written to be backwards compatible where  possible, however I recommend using version 3.0.1 or higher. If you are not using WordPress 3.0.1 or higher and you can upgrade your site, I recommend you do this before installation.
	<p>The theme is widget ready and you can add and configure your own widgets in the side bar,  home page, blog posts, pages and footer. You will see more information about these areas and how to use them later in this document.</p>
	<p>There are several pre-made skins installed with the theme. You can activate any of these from the theme options menu, or you can add your own skin using the "Custom" skin option. There is more information about using custom skins with the theme in the &quot;<a href="#skin">Skinning the Theme</a>&quot; section below.</p>
	<p>Although every effort has been made to ensure the theme is bug free and as easy to use as possible there is always the chance for errors. If you do find a problem please notify us immediately through the <strong><a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Parallelus" target="_blank">ThemeForest account page</a></strong> so we can ensure it gets fixed as quickly as possible.</p>
	<hr>
	<a name="install"></a>
	<h3><strong>Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>Installing the theme can be done two ways. You can upload the zipped theme file, "<span class="mono-bold">theme-traject.zip</span>", using the built in WordPress theme upload, or copy the files through an FTP client.</p>
	<h4>1) Using WordPress Theme Upload</h4>
	<p>This process varies slightly between different versions of WordPress. The instructions below are based on WordPress 3+. If using an older version the basic steps should be the same, although the button names and placement  may be different.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Login to your WordPress admin.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>"Appearance &gt; Themes"</strong> menu click the tab at the top labeled <strong>"Install Themes"</strong></li>
		<li>At the top of the page click, <strong>"Upload"</strong>, then click the file field to select a file.</li>
		<li>Select the zipped theme file and click <strong>"Install Now"</strong></li>
		<li>After installation you will receive a success message confirming your new install.<strong></strong></li>
		<li>Click the link <strong>"Activate"</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<h4>2) Uploading by FTP</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Login to your FTP server and navigate to your WordPress themes directory. <br>
			Normally this would be <strong>"wp-content/themes"</strong></li>
		<li>Extract the files from the zipped theme.</li>
		<li>Copy the folder <strong>"parallelus-traject"</strong> to your themes directory.</li>
		<li>After the files finish uploading, login to your WordPress admin.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>"Appearance"</strong> menu click <strong>"Themes"</strong></li>
		<li>Click <strong>"Activate"</strong> for the theme <strong>"Traject"</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Finished with Installation?</h4>
	<p>Once the theme is installed you can configure it for your content. See the section below on configuring the theme options and you are ready to start adding your own content.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Image Resizing</h3>
	<p>After your theme is installed you should ensure that image resizing is working. To perform image resizing your server must be running PHP-5 and have GD-Library installed. If you don't know if your server has these things, don't worry, most do and the resizing will work automatically. If you want to verify that these are on your server contact your host and they will be able to tell you.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h5><strong>Make the Cache Folder Writeable</strong></h5>
		<p>You must make sure the cache folder "parallelus-traject/cache" is set to write permissions. This is where resized images are saved. The folder needs "777" write permissions. It's likely that this will also work automatically, but if it does not or you have an error message related to your images you should CHMOD the folder to "777". If you need to know how to do this do a web search for "CHMOD folder permissions 777" or check the help file of your FTP program.</p>
		<h5><strong>Resizing Script</strong></h5>
		<p>The theme uses a script named "TimThumb" to perform image resizing. If you need detailed information on using this script or want to make customizations in the code check the TimThumb website for the full documentation and example code: <a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/" target="_blank">TimThumb PHP Script</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Common Image Problems</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="note"><strong>My images are not showing but I can see the placeholder images.</strong></p>
		<p>If you have already completed the steps above to verify your server settings and requirements are not a problem, you my have a problem with image locations or the path. If you can see the placeholder images, but not your own images, you probably have the wrong path to your images. Copy the URL you entered for your image and paste it into the browser URL directly. If you don't see your image the path is the problem. Check the path and make sure an image exists in that location. Once you find the working URL update the image path in the admin.</p>
		<p>If the path to the image works when pasted into the browser, try going directly to the TimThumb file without an image. You should get a message that no image was specified. If you don't get this message or you get a 404 error page, the TimThumb file is missing, or does not have permissions to run on the server, or one of the requirements  (PHP-5 and GD-Library) is not working properly. Contact your host to verfiy these items.</p>
		<p class="note"><strong>Some of my images don't work.</strong></p>
		<p>If you see some images and not others, the problem is mostlikely the image path. Paste it into your browser to test if the image appears. If not, check the path and update it. If you see the image, it could be a permissions issue. TimThumb cannot resize images from other sites so your images must be hosted on the same domain when using TimThumb.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<hr>
	<a name="config"></a>
	<h3><strong>Configuring the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>Once the theme is installed you will see a new menu on the bottom left of your WordPress admin. The theme menu contains the following areas:<br>
	</p>
	<h4>General Options</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This area contains settings for choosing your skin, changing your logo,  footer setup and more.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Skins</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose a skin (<a href="#skin">skin information</a>)</li>
					<li>Wide Layout</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Logo</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Main Logo</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</blockquote>
	<a name="mainmenu"></a>
	<h4>Main Menu</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The theme has a custom menu management feature for the main menu. This is where you will configure what does and does not appear in your main drop down menu. The items in the menu can be dragged into the position you want them to appear. To start, click the "Add new menu item" and it will create the item on the page. To make a sub-menu item, drag it beneath another menu item and slightly inset, visual layout will change on the page and you will immediately see the item nested below it's parent.</p>
		<p><strong class="note">NOTE:</strong> Be sure to always save your changes. Dragging items and deleting them will not take effect unless you click the save button after making the changes.</p>
		<h5>Menu Elements</h5>
		<p>The following types of items can be added to the menu:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Menu Item<br>
			</strong>This is a default menu link. Adding this element will create a standard link that is clickable and goes to the page of you're choosing.
				The following options exist for this item:
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Title<br>
					</strong>This is the text the link displays.<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Description<br>
					</strong>This is a description used to populate the link's &quot;Title&quot; field which describes the link or where it goes.<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Heading<br>
					</strong>Checking this option will display the item as a column heading in a sub-menu list. This should only be used on sub-menu items and not the main root level links.<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Link<br>
					</strong>Where the link should go. If you want the link to be text only an not go to any page, slect the &quot;URL&quot; option and enter &quot;#&quot; as the path.<br>
						<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Column Break<br>
			</strong>This is for sub-menu's only. Adding this element will define the end of a column of links before beginning a new column. This is what allows the Mega Menu sub-menus to have multiple lists of links side-by-side.<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Row Break<br>
			</strong>This is for sub-menu's only. Adding this element will define the end of a horizontal row of links before beginning a new row beneath it. When adding a new row, it is best to attempt to keep a consistant number of columns on each row.<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Text Block<br>
			</strong>Add this to insert your own text, HTML or images into a menu. If you wish to create a custom list of links with your own icons or have images, tables, forms or other complex layouts in the menu this element will enable you to do these things.</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	<a name="homepage"></a>
	<h4>Home Page</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The home page section allows you to configure the source of the home page content. It can pull from a selected page, or in a blog format from a selection of categories. The following options are available from the Home Page menu:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Showcase</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Showcase Columns</strong> - number of widget areas</li>
					</ul>
			</li>

	-	Additional	options	in	&quot;Featured Content&quot; menu.

								</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Post List </strong>

						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>

		<p>The home page has a pre-set sidebar that already exists in the Widgets area, &quot;Homepage Sidebar&quot;. This is the area where you should add widgets for the home page. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="http://para.llel.us/themes/traject-wp/wp-content/themes/parallelus-traject/theme_admin/images/documentation/home-screen-shot.jpg" width="600" alt="Home Screen Shot"></p>
	</blockquote>
	<a name="slideshow"></a>
	<h4>Slide show</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The slide show menu allows you to add slides, sort the order they display and the transition effect used for each image. If images don't display you should check the paths, if they seem correct, try using a full path with your entire URL including the "http://domain.com" in the path. If you can enter that path into your browser and see the image it should also display in the slide show area.</p>
		<p>Slide show links can be added so clicking a slide will direct the visitor to a page or website. This feature only works with the default "Cycle" slide show and not the "Gallery View" or &quot;Nivo&quot; options. Links URL's are ignored if you choose "Gallery View" or &quot;Nivo&quot; as your slide show. The transitions, overlay text and slide navigation options are also only function with the default &quot;Cycle&quot; slide show.</p>
		<p><span class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Be sure to always save changes. Dragging items and deleting slides will not take effect unless you click the save button after making the changes.</p>
	</blockquote>

				</strong>The path to the image for the current item.<br>
				<br>

	<h3>Layout and Design Structure - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p> Included with the theme is a copy of the HTML only version. This is provided to make it easier to build custom additions or modify the theme as you choose. It's easier to see the structure of the site in the original HTML files than from piecing together WordPress pages. Within the HTML pages is additional documentation about the theme. Below are references to these pages where you can learn more about the layout structures, text formatting and other features. If you want to access these files directly they are located in the "theme_admin/HTML-Version" folder. </p>

		<h4><strong>Alternate Layout Option</strong></h4>
		<p>An optional full width layout has been provided as an alternative to the &quot;page&quot; style defautl layout. The primary difference is the container and background graphics will expand to the full width of your browser in the alternate layout. This option can be enabled from the theme admin &quot;Skin&quot; options.</p>
		<h4>Cufon - font replacement</h4>
		<p>This theme takes advantage of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/">cufon font replacement</a> for headings and other title elements. The font used, &quot;Vegur&quot;, is a free font available online. If you have missing characters in your titles, such as accent marks or symbols, you will need to recreate the cufon file. To do this, download the font file from the link below, and using the <a href="http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/">cufon</a> website, create a new font replacement JavaScript file. Include the  glyphs you require for your text and replace the existing file in the theme &quot;<strong>www/js</strong>&quot; folder. This should not be necessary in most cases. Exceptions may include the need for Russian characters, special accent marks, etc.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.fontspace.com/arro/vegur">Download "Vegur"</a></p>
		<p>Thre are two different Cufon files used in the theme, &quot;Vegur.font.js&quot; and &quot;Vegur.Light.font.js&quot;. If you have missing characters you should update both files.</p>
		<p>NOTE: If you are experiencing problems or want to disable Cufon, you can do this from the theme options <strong>&quot;General Options</strong> &gt;   <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Font Replacement</strong>&quot; menu.</p>
		<h4>Logo Fonts</h4>
		<p>The logos in the included skins use &quot;Steiner&quot; as the font. This is a free font available online.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.dafont.com/steiner.font?text=TRAJECT">Download "Steiner"</a></p>
		<h4>Skins and Design</h4>
		<p>There are several pre-made skins included with the theme. For detailed information on creating custom skins or using a single skin please refer to the &quot;<a href="#skin"><strong>Skinning the Theme</strong></a>&quot; section of this document.</p>
		<p><span class="note">Note:</span> Although every effort has been made to ensure the theme is bug free and easy to use, if you encounter a problem please notify me immediately through my <strong><a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Parallelus" target="_blank">ThemeForest account page</a></strong> so I can ensure it gets fixed as quickly as possible.</p>

		<h3>CSS Files and Structure - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>There are several CSS files included with this theme, but only a few will be necessary for customization. The CSS files are all located in the root theme folder. The only exception to this is plugin specific style sheets which are located in a sub-folder named "css". Within that folder there are two sub-folders, "source" and "skins-originals".</p>
	<p>The first folder, <strong>&quot;css/source</strong>&quot;, contains the original CSS files with formatted code and comments. Only a few files are in this folder. These files might include the original CSS files for add-on scripts used in the design. If you  find a CSS file that is uncommented and you need the original, check this folder.</p>
		<p>The second folder, &quot;<strong>css/skins-originals</strong>&quot;, contains a backup copy of the CSS skin files.</p>
	<h4>Primary CSS Files</h4>
	<blockquote>
			<h5> <strong>style-default.css</strong> (required)</h5>
		<p>This file provides the foundation for the site design and all skins. It controls the layout and design structure of the theme. Making modifications to this file will usually effect all skins unless it is a color or image related change. The skin files act as an extension of &quot;<strong>style-default.css</strong>&quot; to apply custom colors and graphics. Before you edit this file you should consider making a custom skin style sheet or editing the one you are already using for your design.</p>
			<h5> <strong>style-skin-#.css</strong> </h5>
		<p>These are the skin specific style sheets. These files are named numerically in a format such as, &quot;<strong>skin-#.css</strong>&quot;. To change the skin, use the menu option under "<strong>General Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Choose a skin</strong>". This will switch between any of the 5 existing skins included with the theme. If you have created a custom skin, you can select the "Custom" option from this menu. In the text box that appears, type the name of your custom skin CSS file (omitting the "<strong>.css</strong>" file extension). For example, if you create a skin CSS file named "<strong>my-skin.css</strong>" you would save it in the theme folder and type "<strong>my-skin</strong>" in the custom name field.</p>

	<h3>Skinning the Theme - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>Each  color style, &quot;skin&quot;, is controlled by a custom CSS  file. These are located in the theme folder &quot;<strong>parallelus-traject</strong>&quot;. The images for each skin are saved in a folder under <strong>&quot;images/skins/skin-123/</strong>&quot; where &quot;<strong>skin-123</strong>&quot; is the name of your CSS file. To create a custom skin, duplicate an existing skin CSS files and edit it as desired. You can easily output the custom graphics for you skin using one of the &quot;<strong>Theme Graphics - for skinning.PSD</strong>&quot; files located in the &quot;<strong>Design\Files for skinning</strong>&quot; folded included with the theme.</p>
	<p>After creating the skin CSS file and a matching images folder, save your images to this new  folder. Use the &quot;<strong>Save for web...</strong>&quot; feature of Photoshop and select &quot;<strong>All user slices</strong>&quot; to get the desired graphics. You can create a custom skin in a few minutes by modifying the background colors of the main  layers in this file. If you want to get more detailed and tweak the output you can edit the individual colors, highlights, borders and shadows of the layers above the background. Taking some time to play with the different layers to see what effect they have can be very helpful in the beginning. This file was designed to allow easy and fast skinning but also alows you to control the detials of each graphic element output for the design.</p>
	<p><span class="note">IMPORTANT: </span>If you are going to create a custom skin or do any advanced code   editing, you may need to edit the JavaScript loading file, "<strong>js/onLoad.js</strong>".   This file controls  loading and executing of many dynamic JavaScript   functions used in the theme. To edit the file, you should use the source located in &quot;<strong>js/source/onLoad.js</strong>&quot;</p>
	<h4>To create a single skin for your site</h4>
	<p>The best way to go about creating your own skin, is by starting from one of the pre-made styles that come with the theme. An easy way to do this would be as follows:</p>
<ol>
			<li>First, create a copy of an existing style sheet from the theme folder &quot;<strong>style-skin-#.css</strong>&quot;, and increment the # to the next unused value. </li>
			<li>Create a duplicate of the same skin's images folder located in &quot;<strong>images/skins/skin-#</strong>&quot;</li>
			<li>Give your new images folder the same name as the CSS file by incrementing the number to match.</li>
		<li>Open the &quot;<strong>Theme Graphics - for skinning.psd</strong>&quot; file in the &quot;<strong>Design/Files for skinning</strong>&quot; folder and modify the colors to create your desired graphics.</li>
			<li>Output the graphics using &quot;<strong>Save for web...</strong>&quot; to the new skin's images folder. Choose &quot;<strong>All user created slices</strong>&quot; as the option for output method when asked.</li>
			<li>Open the new CSS file for your skin. Do a find and replace for the path to your images folder, this would be something like, Find: &quot;<strong>skin-8</strong>&quot;, Replace with: &quot;<strong>skin-9</strong>&quot;, to update all occurrences of the image folder path in the file. Save when finished.</li>
		<li>Upload your new skin CSS file and images folder to the theme folder for "<strong>parallelus-traject</strong>" on your server.</li>
			<li>Change the skin setting in the Theme Options to "<strong>Custom</strong>" and type the name of your skin file, "<strong>my-skin</strong>", omitting the ".css" file extension.</li>
			<li>Save your settings and preview the new skin.</li>
			<li>In the WordPress "<strong>Appearance &gt; Editor</strong>" panel, open your new skin CSS file and begin editing the individual style properties to match the graphics you have created for your new skin.</li>
			<li>Save and enjoy!</li>

	<h3>Special Features - <a href="#toc">top</a><br></h3>
	<h4>Button Style Disabling</h4>
	<p>The custom button styles will automatically apply to any &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input type=&quot;[submit or button]&quot;&gt; on your page. In some situations you may need a button not to have these styles to preserve special functionality. You can add the class &quot;noStyle&quot; to any button and it will be ignored by the button styling function.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code>&lt;button class=&quot;noStyle&quot;&gt;Do Not Style This Button&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
		</blockquote>		<h4>Specialty Links</h4>
		<p>You can add several special types of links to tap into built in functionality of the theme.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<h5><strong>Content Pop-ups</strong></h5>
		<p>You can  add links that activate the custom pop-up modal window. Include the path to the page you want to open and append the following:</p>
		<p><strong>Any content as pop-up (class=&quot;iframe&quot;):</strong> You can  enter any URL and add the class &quot;iframe&quot;  and it will open in a pop-up. This can be an internal or external path, for example:</p>
		<blockquote><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; class=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</code></blockquote>
		<p> This can be useful for linking to maps or other informational content.</p>
		<h5><strong>Image Pop-ups</strong></h5>
		<p>You can open any image in a pop-up by including the URL for the image in a links HREF attribute and giving it the class &quot;zoom&quot; as demonstrated below:</p>
		<code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://mysite.com/myImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;View Image&lt;/a&gt;</code>
		<h5><strong>Video Pop-ups</strong></h5>
		<p>You can open  many web videos in a pop-up by including the URL for the video in a links HREF attribute and giving it the class &quot;zoom&quot; as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iGRpC8U3x8&quot; class=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;
	Open Video Pop-up
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<h5><strong>Image Hover Effects</strong></h5>
<p>There are several hover effects that can be applied to different image links. For this to work you need to have the image contained in the default image container included with the them. Add the class for the type of hover effect you want and it will be applied automatically.</p>
<p><span class="note">Note:</span> This can also be done using the shortcode<span class="mono-bold"> [styled_image] </span>and setting the &quot;<strong>icon</strong>&quot; paramater to &quot;<strong>zoom</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>play</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>doc</strong>&quot; to get the desired overlay icon.</p>
<ul>
		<li><strong>class=&quot;iconPlay&quot;</strong> - for video play button hover effect</li>
		<li><strong>class=&quot;iconZoom&quot;</strong> - for zoom button hover effect</li>
		<li><strong>class=&quot;iconDoc&quot;</strong> - for document or content button hover effect</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is and example of how this could be applied:</p>

	<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;myBigImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;zoom imgMedium <strong style="font-size:1.1em; color: #000;">iconZoom</strong>&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailImage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;imgFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
	<h5>Pop-ups</h5>
	<p><strong>Any content as pop-up (#popup):</strong> You can optionally enter any URL for a link into a WordPress text editor or the menu and and append "#popup" to the link and it will open in a pop-up. This can be an internal or external path, for example "<strong>http://www.google.com#popup</strong>" will load Google in a popup window inside your page. This can be great for linking to maps or other informational content.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Custom Image Containers</h4>
	<p>The theme includes 4 custom image containers. They require a couple different elements to be used but are easy to copy and paste from the examplse in the sample documents. Below are additional examples of each:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><span class="note">Note: </span>This can also be done using the shortcode<span class="mono-bold"> [styled_image] </span>and setting the &quot;<strong>size</strong>&quot; paramater to &quot;<strong>small</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>medium&quot;</strong>, &quot;<strong>tall</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>blog</strong>&quot; to get the desired overlay icon.</p>
		<p><strong>Large Image (seen in Blog preview pages)</strong></p>
		<p>Applied by adding <code>class=&quot;imgLarge&quot;</code> to the main container.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;myBigImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLarge&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailImage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;imgFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
		<p>The above example could also be created using a &lt;div&gt; main container instead of the &lt;a&gt; link shown if you don't want the image to be a hyperlink. This applies to all image containers.</p>
		<p><strong>Medium Image (seen in main Portfolio preview page)</strong></p>
		<p>Applied by adding <code>class=&quot;imgMedium&quot;</code> to the main container.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;myBigImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgMedium&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailImage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;imgFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
		<p><strong>Small Image (seen in FAQ's preview page - at the bottom, 4 column layout)</strong></p>
		<p>Applied by adding <code>class=&quot;imgSmall&quot;</code> to the main container.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;myBigImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgSmall&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailImage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;imgFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>	
		<p><strong>Tall Image (seen in Portfolio 2 sample page)</strong></p>
		<p>Applied by adding <code>class=&quot;imgTall&quot;</code> to the main container.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;myBigImage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgTall&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailImage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;imgFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
